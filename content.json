However, I have found it quite difficult to install the Dart protobuf plugin on Linux. Here is my tutorial for you to save your time. Install Dart Following the instruction here to install Dart Dart SDK For me, I just download the deb file and install it. sudo dpkg -i dart_2.1.0-1_amd64.deb After that we can use dart in terminal, but we cannot find pub . The reason is beacuse it is located in usr/lib/dart/bin Therefore, we’d better change the PATH permanently. Change the PATH permanently for pub gedit ~/.profile Then add the following to the end of .profile export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin Logout and login again to let the modification take effect. Type pub in terminal, we will see it works. Install protoc The simplest way is to use to precompiled protoc binary and put it into PATH Protobuf Release For me, I download the protoc-3.6.1-osx-x86_64.zip. Unzip it, and put protoc binary to /usr/bin Then, we type protoc in terminal, we will see it works. Install Dart protoc_plugin In the terminal, type pub global activate protoc_plugin Right now, I’m in China. For reasons known to all, I have to use the mirror export PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://pub.flutter-io.cn However, it is installed in $HOME/.pub-cache/bin. We’d better make it into PATH again. Using the same way in ~/.profile Now, the last line looks like export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin You need to logout and login to again to take effect. Compile from .proto file Finally, we can compile .proto file to .dart file. For me, I just go to the directory containing the .proto file, using the command below, and it will generate the .dart file(s) you need. You can copy them to your flutter project protc --dart_out=. ./YourFile.proto Install protobuf runtime library Don’t forget to install the runtime library by adding protobuf: ^0.11.0 in your dependency part of pubspec.yaml That’s it! Hope it will save your time to build your flutter project with awesome protobuf!","link":"/2019/01/12/Using-Protobuf-In-Flutter/"},{"title":"Try iDict in Command Line","text":"command line version of iDict for macOs&amp;Windows&amp;Linux 适用macOs, Windows(64位)和Linux的命令行版本iDict英语词典,包含330W词库以及来自权威词典的双语例句。 轻量级,包含所有依赖的可执行文件,下载即用。 同时推荐微信小程序版本，在移动端获取极佳体验 Install请去Release页面下载对应的可执行文件 Linux wget https://github.com/AntiSomnus/iDict-cmd/releases/download/[latest-release-number]/idict_linux &amp;&amp; chmod a+x idict_linux Make sure to change [latest-release-number] to the number of release, e.g 2.0 Or you can just go to Release page to download the latest version. add the location to the path ln -s /location/to/idict_linux /usr/local/bin/idict idict welcome idict welcome -d idict welcome -d 3 Windows Just go to Release page to download the latest version. add the location to the path idict welcome idict welcome -d idict welcome -d 3 macOs macOs上使用需要brew安装openssl wget https://github.com/AntiSomnus/iDict-cmd/releases/download/[latest-release-number]/idict_macos &amp;&amp; chmod a+x idict_macos Make sure to change [latest-release-number] to the number of release, e.g 2.0 Or you can just go to Release page to download the latest version. make sure you have openssl installed brew install openssl add the location to the path ln -s /location/to/idict_macos /usr/local/bin/idict idict welcome idict welcome -d idict welcome -d 3 Usageidict word [-d|--detail [max-sentences-per-dict] ]word the word you want to query 你想要查询的单词,默认不包含例句-d | --detail get the detailed info of the word 获取单词详细释义，包含例句 max-sentences-per-dict(default=2) 显示的例句数量，默认为2 Exampleidict welcomeidict welcome -didict welcome -d 1 Color (Beta in win64_python version)修改color.ini即可修改颜色 New python version will give you the flexibility to change color configuration.
